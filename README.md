## 📝 About This Project

This portfolio represents my journey from Java development to learning the MERN stack. I learned a lot while making this:

- How to structure React components
- Managing state with useState and useEffect
- Responsive design with CSS
- System theme detection and theme management
- Handling user interactions
- Deploying a React app

Coming from a Java background, it's been exciting to learn modern web development technologies!

### Styling
- `src/App.css`: Main stylesheet for all components
- `src/index.css`: Global styles and animations

### Colors and Theme
The portfolio uses a modern color scheme with:
- Primary Blue: `#2563eb`
- Secondary Purple: `#667eea` to `#764ba2` (gradient)
- Accent Yellow: `#fbbf24`
- Text Colors: Various shades of gray

## 📱 What I Learned

Building this portfolio taught me:
- How to make websites work on different screen sizes
- Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Adding smooth animations and transitions
- Creating a theme system with system detection
- Making forms that handle user input

## 🎨 Design Choices

I tried to keep the design simple but modern:
- Clean, readable fonts
- Smooth animations when hovering over buttons
- A color scheme that works in both light and dark modes
- Simple but effective layout
